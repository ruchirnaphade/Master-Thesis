## Title

Development of an interaction concept for efficient multimedia annotations to 3D models in Augmented Reality

## Abstract

Recent advancements in immersive technologies have introduced new possibilities to use Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) to visualize 3D models in the design review process. Research has also shown that many different industries utilize these technologies to perform design reviews. However, how feedback can be provided to 3D models and how the provided feedback can be saved to share with distributed designers or other stakeholders has not yet been investigated. There is thus a need for the use of this technology that enables feedback provision to 3D models and documentation provision of this feedback.

In this thesis, an interactive feedback solution is developed to efficiently provide multimedia annotations to 3D models in AR-based design reviews. The solution is developed in such a way that 3D models can be visualized interactively, and multimedia annotations can be provided to 3D models efficiently and intuitively. This solution also provides a mechanism to document feedback in AR to share it with dispersed stakeholders and provides a mechanism to recreate it easily. The developed feedback solution is then tested with different 3D models using the Unity game engine. This solution is evaluated to check whether the product design's common aspects can be reviewed and annotated in the AR-based product design review process. The evaluation results show that the developed feedback solution can visualize all the aspects of the product design and provide annotations to any 3D models. Moreover, the results also proved that annotations can be documented systematically and recreated efficiently in an AR environment.

## Goal of the thesis

The goal of this thesis is to develop an interactive, intuitive, and efficient solution to provide feedback to 3D models using multimedia annotations in AR-based design reviews. This solution is then prototypically implemented for the Microsoft HoloLens 2. In order to achieve the goal of this thesis, systematic research needs to be done.

Hence, to achieve the goal of the thesis, first, the design review process in PDP needs to be studied thoroughly. Different approaches are being used to conduct a design review process in different industries. Hence, it is essential to find out these commonly used approaches and how they are being conducted. Also, essential things that are being considered for feedback while conducting a design review and necessary types of feedback need to be investigated in the thesis. Moreover, it is also necessary to discover the limitations of these traditional approaches and solutions to overcome these limitations.

Similarly, AR technology, its types, AR devices, features provided by AR, etc., need to be explored thoroughly. Then, AR approaches for conducting design reviews have to be studied meticulously. It is crucial to find out the most efficient and commonly used interaction modalities are used for AR-based design reviews. Also, an analysis of these approaches needs to be done to determine the challenges that arise while conducting design reviews. Based on the analysis, a concept for interactions to provide multimedia annotations to 3D models needs to be developed.

Furthermore, the developed concept needs to be used as a base to define and implement a prototype for Microsoft HoloLens 2 in this thesis. Also, an evaluation of the developed prototype should be done to conclude this thesis with a comprehensive summary and outlook.
